# Spotify Playlists

This is a simple React app that connects to Spotify's API to present Spotify's editorial playlists to the user. After connecting to and getting authorized by the Spotify API, the user can navigate through different music categories, which update the playlists visible to the viewer through React context. The user can click on a playlist to see more detailed information, including a track list and links to the actual playlist on Spotify. All playlist data is fetched directly from Spotify's API following RESTful API protocols. The app also utilizes a backend Express server initially to access Spotify's access token for authorization.
